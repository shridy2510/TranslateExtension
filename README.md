TranslateExtension
Description:
This is a Chrome extension that, when I double-click a word on a webpage, it can recognize and translate it. It shows the phonetic transcription and pronunciation (with a speaker icon), and then automatically saves the word to storage so I can review it later.

Use case:
Me â€” because Google Translate and other translation extensions suck. Most of them only translate part of the word or phrase, they don't have examples and they usually donâ€™t have a speaker icon, so I have no idea how to pronounce it properly.

Goal:
This project is just a learning experience for future projects.

Tech stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chrome Storage API

Example:
When I double-clicked case on some random website, it showed:

case        âœ•
/keÉªs/
ðŸ”Š
